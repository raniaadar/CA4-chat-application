Design Report

Introduction

For the fourth assessment we are asked to create a website that functions as both a personal portfolio, as well as a chat application. In order to do this, we utilise HTML, CSS, as well as Bootstrap features and Javascript. 

Design

I went for a sleek monochrome look, using black, white and gray. This keeps the look professional (which is essential to a portfolio) as well as remaining easy to read and digest for any new visitors of the website. The chat application stands out with a simple input box and submit button. It allows users to type any message they want and communicate with any other user that visits the website. On the side bar, a list of active users can be found, making it easy to keep track of the traffic on the site. As well as this, time stamps are included with each message by users to make navigation easier. It provides a simple yet effective form of communication between users.
